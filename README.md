# My Little Beholder

A Javascript Adventure mini-game

## Description

My Little Beholder is the first of my General Assembly unit end projects. The challenge was to make a game using Javascript, HTML, CSS and other technologies. I chose to make an adventure using jQuery.

## Getting Started

### Running

* Download the entire repository by clicking "code > Download ZIP"
* Unzip the file using your prefered applicaiton
* Open "index.html" using any up-to-date browser

### Playing the game

* On opening the application, The Interface should appear.
* WARNING, as a joke, pressing the B key will result in the entire stylesheet being swapped for a junked up one. press any other key to return to normal.
* First, Name your beholder anything, then click "Send 'em into the dungeon!"
* At any point, click the little sound icon at the top-right of the window to mute audio.
* As your beholder enters the dungeon, read the situation your beholder has come across and choose the best option for your beholder.
* Keep an eye on your beholder's stats: HP is how healthy your beholder is, Eyestalks represent how powerful your beholder is, Sanity affects your beholder's grasp on reality, and Happiness is important to keep your beholder motivated as they move through the dungeon!
